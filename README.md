I recommend you use this in a setup where `/` gets wiped every reboot.

## Installation using flakes

`/etc/nixos/flake.nix`
```nix
{
  inputs = {
    # ...
    fhs.url = "github:GermanBread/nixos-fhs/stable";
    # ...
  };

  outputs = { ..., fhs, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.<host> = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      # ...
      modules = [
        # ...
        fhs.nixosModules.default
        # ...
        ./configuration.nix
        # ...
      ];
      # ...
    };
  };
}
```
